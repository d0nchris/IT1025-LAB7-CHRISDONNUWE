### Class ------shark
### inheritance---definition of a shark
### object-----sammy
### Abstraction-----A specific type of shark
### Encapsulation--- swim(self)
An object(sammy) is something that performs related activities, a class(shark) is a representation of a type of object, Encapsulation(swim(self))is the resources needed for the object to function,inheritance is the definition of a class (shark),and Abstration is the specific type of a class(shark).
